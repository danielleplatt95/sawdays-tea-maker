Sawday's Tea Round Decider

I have created a very simple application using HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript to decide who is to make the next tea round!
I have made this easy to run and incredibly simple so that set up time is reduced in getting it to run is nice and easy :-)

Set up instructions:

* Download
* Run on apache server

Enjoy!
